# NumPy-Practice-My-Data-Science-Journey
Documenting my step-by-step journey into Data Science and Machine Learning.

Hi! I’m learning Data Science and Machine Learning step by step.
This repo is where I upload my practice files to track my progress and share my learning journey with others.

About this Repo
  Covers NumPy basics (arrays, indexing, slicing, operations).
  Will expand to Pandas, Matplotlib, and Machine Learning as I learn them.
  Shows my growth as a student from beginner level.

Current File
numpy_practice.ipynb – Exercises I did while learning NumPy fundamentals.

Why I’m Uploading This
  To document my journey as a student.
  To build my portfolio step by step.
  To motivate myself and connect with other learners.

Future Plans
  Add more modules (Pandas, Data Visualization, ML basics).
  Upload small projects showing what I’ve learned.
  Keep improving my code and notes over time.
